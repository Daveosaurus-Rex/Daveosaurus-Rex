					Much of what is attributed to Archie, he never said. <br>
					<br><br>
                    I have concluded that although Archie is often cited as a foundational paper, 
					the paper itself remains seldom read by the citees.<br>
					<br><br>
                     Arcie's paper contains only six equations. I go through Archie's analysis one equation at a time.
					When I conclude you will have a definative understanding of what Archie did not say. 
					It will probably change some of	what you presently believe that Archie discovered.

						Is the "neutron-density" crossplot properly scaled as a ternary diagram? <br>
					<br>
						It may be a reflection on how people learn, and how they are taught, petrophysics, at least in the USA.
						A friend at ExxonMobil, Craig Tingy, and I, both late in our careers in formation evaluation, had different ideas on
						how the interior of the sand-shale-water triangle in the neutron-density crossplot should be scaled. 
						This may have, most probably did, result from differences in training and background. Craig was a
						geologist with all that that implies regarding exposure to ternary diagrams. I was trained as a 
						Schlumberger field engineer with a B.S. in Physics in the age when Schlumberger was busy promoting
						Saraband, its shaly-sand interpretation method. I was never taught about ternary diagrams. 
						Yet, at this late stage in our careers, our two different methodologies clashed. Had we had education
						rather than training, we would have known that these representations were two sides of the same, valid, coin.<br>

						You know about the Arps Approximation. If you do formation evaluation you probably can 
						write it down without looking for a reference. Do you know where it comes from?  Do you 
						know where it comes from? Have you ever read Arps' paper? <br>
						<br>
						I fooled around with this data for a long time trying to develop a better salinity-temperature-
						resistivity transform, looking to capture the curvature of the iso-salinity (or iso-concentration)
						lines which are suggested by the data. The "approximation" in Arps' approximation is to 
						replace the curved iso-saliniity lines with straight lines. In manipulating the data
						graphically in search of trends, I noticed that the change in conductivity with respect to
						temperature is proportional to temperature and a function of salinity. This last sentence
						is easily written down as an elementary differential equation. The solution is a definite
						integral between a referece temperature and a formation temperature. If two different formation
						tempertures are chosen, and the resulting equations are "ratioed", the funtion of salinity
						cancels out, and the resulting formula is the Arps approximation. The whole derivation from 
						differential equation to final formula following in about five - very simple to follow -
						lines of math. It takes much more ink to explain that it (as above) than to do it. 
						Of course, to agree with me that a differential equation is simple, you'd have to 
						know what a differential equation is in the first place. Still, if you'd had calculus
						and stopped short of differential equations (or you've forgot the techniques learned
						long ago) you can still appreciate the algebra, once the differential equation is integrated;
						that is, solved. The result is still the Arps approximation; i.e., it is not any more
						accurate merely because it has be derived analytically, as opposed to Arps' statistical
						approch. But it may give you comfort, as it does me, that it is really very easy to explain.<br>

					Have you ever seen a resistivity log "flatline" at about 2000 ohm-meters? 
					<br><br>
					2000 is a "big" number, the highest on the resistivity logarithmic scale.
					Does this mean that there is "too much resistivity to measure"?
					Well, that is not the most accurate way to think about what you're looking at.
					In fact, the physical situration is just about the exact opposite. It might
					sould like quibbling about semantics, but it isn't. The actual situration is 
					that there is too little conductivity for the insturment to respond to accurately.
					The formation conductivity is too close to zero for the instrument to have
                    any output except electronic noise. This happens when the conductivity is less than
					about 0.0005 Siemens per meter; the reciprocal of the apparent conductivity would 
					then be 2000 ohm-meters and the service company, not wanting you to interpret 
					electronic noise as something in the formation, truncates (or clips) the apparent 
					resistivity curve at 2000 (sometimes less depending on the instrument) ohm-meters.

					You may not know that in spite of several claims to the contrary, the Archie model had eluded
					attempts to derive it from more fundatmental first principles. It appears that the thought never
					occured to anyone to try. Well, no one was doing "theoretical petrophysics". Still, you would have thought . . .
					Parita Sen, then at the Schlumberger-Doll Lab published a claim of deriving Archie's law from 
					a first principle in 1982, the the "first principle" was in fact the Hani-Bruggeman "effective medium" model, hardly a
					first principle, and the porosity exponent thus derived was 3/2 exactly rather than the Archie
					approximate 4/2. So, it's the 1980s and no one is succeeding.
					<br><br>					
					That is ... until the early 1990s when Dr. David Herrick, having worked long and hard to understand 
					the resistivity interpretation paradigm in use up to that time, decided it simply could not be 
					understood on the basis of Ohm's law and arm-waving. He finished his thinking while a researcher 
					at Mobil's Dallas Research Laboratory and published his findings in 1993 and 1994 with his coauthor, me.
					<br><br>
					The basis of Herrick's theory was to state a set of three physically obvious and eminently reasonable "first principles".
					These are: The bulk conductivity of a class of rocks of interest is proportional to: (1) the conductivity of the brine
					in the rock; (2) the amount of brine in the rock; (3) the geometrical configuration (i.e., brine geometry) of the brine 
					in the rock. The restriction of "a class of rocks" refers to rocks whose conductivity depends upon the 
					brine (and only the brine) in the rock. There are other restrictions such as the rocks should have primary 
					porosity only and no fractures. The class of rocks corresponds to rocks where Archie's model works
					well and are therefore called "Archie Rocks". The new model was first dubbed the "Electrical Efficiency
					Theory" and later the name shifted to the "Geometrical Factor Theory". The Archie model is a special case of the GFT.
					<br><br>
					I always had a nagging suspicion that the model had not been fully developed, and introduced percolation
					threshold concepts into a similar model (PPTT) in 2007. The Archie model was also a special case of this theory; however, 
					the GFT and PPTT models were not the same; I suspected one of them must therefore be in error.
					Finally, by fully generalizing the GFT, I was able to show that	the original GFT and PPTT are both
					special cases of a more general model, a generalized geometrical factor model (GGFT). It turns out that
					GGFT is able to accomodate the "classical" shaly-sand models (Waxman-Smits & Dual Water) as special 
					cases.  					
					<br><br>
					However, one thing that remained constant throughout the development is Herrick's three first principles.
					If you absorb this video, I guarantee your insight into how rocks conduct electricity, and understanding
					of the various saturation models, is going to improve over what it was when you got your popcorn
					and sat down to watch.

					In 1968 Waxman and Smits, representing Shell, and benefiting from Shell's reputation as
                    the industy's leading experts in petrophysics, trading upon G. E. Archie's pioneering discoveries,
                    introduced a model for the conductivity interpretation of oil-bearing shaly sands. The model
					relied upon electrochemical theory; however, the paper was not tutorial in any way. In addition to
					its being non-tutorial and written mainly to their fellow electrochemists at Shell, is among
					the most inscrutably written papers in the oil-patch literature. <br>
					<br>
					The Waxman-Smits model acquired the patina of being derived from first principles mainly from
					its invincible impenetrableness and formation evaluator's credulousness due to Shell's reputation
					in petrophysics. The the model was challenged a decade later by Clavier, Coates, and Dumanoir of
					Schlumberger and their alternative Dual Water Model. However, Shell being one of Schlumberger's
					major custormers, the challenge was delivered with a velvet touch. Moreover, the Dual Water Model
					had problems of its own. <br>
					<br>
					This video deconstucts the theoretical basis of the Waxman-Smits model on its own terms. I show
                    that it is not, as it claims to be, a parallel conductivity model. This is not to say that it is 
					not a "useful" model. It is certainly better than "no model", and its parameters are measurable
					in the laboratory. It has been an industry standard model for a long time. I hope this video
					clarifies some of its foundations.
