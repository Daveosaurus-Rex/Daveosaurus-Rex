Hi Y'all

Your Skeptical Petrophysicist here. You can call me Dave.

Did you ever see and hear anything in your formation evaluation / petrophyscis training that struck you as, let's say, not sufficiently justified?

In my training, which began in 1973 at Schlumberger's Ventura Learning Center, I was certainly exposed in a very cursory way to most of the "petrophysical theory" that I was supposed to eventually master. I now realize that my mentors at the learning center were there to teach well-logging and not petrophysics, so of course they could only repeat what they had heard in their own training. Over the course of a career one learns that very few of our colleagues have more than a thin veneer of petrophysical knowledge covering a void in deep understanding. 

The mission of QED Petrophysics is to provide a more insightful and detailed understanding of topics in petrophyscal science that need more explanation that most instructors are able to provide.

Although I'm still filling in the gaps such instruction left in my own background,  I've already bridged many of those gaps with step-by-step explanations of what is knowable and already known, what might be knowable but is not yet known, and what is probably not knowable. 

This website is my platform to share my insights. I hope it is helpful to you.
